##TheHarvester

All of this code comes from Laramies' TheHarvester tool. The original code can be found here:

>https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester

It is include din Viper for simplicity. Viper can call TheHarvester directly rather than run the tool (if it is installed) and re-format the output. Only the code/files necessary for Viper are included.
